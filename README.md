### Hi there 👋 I'm John!

I'm a student at NC State University studying Political Science and Computer Science. Weird combo, right? I just like both!

I'm currently serving as the Vice President of NC State's Linux Users' Group, and help out with organizing Hackpack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

I spent this past summer as a Data Analyst intern at Red Hat, where I developed Python and Javascript tools to automate data cleaning processes.

Areas of interest include software and web security, computer architecture, and cryptography.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... a terminal client for HackerNews, but I'm mostly focused on school.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... principals of software engineering through NCSU's CSC 216.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything!
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him/His
