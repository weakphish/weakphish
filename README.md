### Hi there 👋 I'm Jack!

I'm a graduate of NC State University, where I majored in Political Science with a minor in Computer Programming. My senior year (2021-2022), I served as the President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

Currently, I work as a software engineer in Cisco's CollabAI organization. Before that, I worked as an SRE in Cisco's Network Services.

Areas of interest include software and systems, static analysis, and programming language design.
