### Hi there 👋 I'm Jack!

I'm a software engineer passionate about tooling, building platforms, and game dev.

Currently, I work as a software engineer in Cisco's CollabAI organization, making collaboration smarter and more efficient. 

Before that, I worked as an SRE in Cisco's Network Services, automating data center networks and developing supporting microservices.
