### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jack!

I'm a graduate of NC State University, where I majored in Political Science with a minor in Computer Programming. My senior year (2021-2022), I served as the President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

Currently, I work as a software engineer in Cisco's CollabAI organization, making collaboration smarter and more efficient. 

Before that, I worked as an SRE in Cisco's Network Services, automating data center networks and developing supporting microservices.
