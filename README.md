### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jack!

I'm a recent graduate of NC State University, where I majored in Political Science with a minor in Computer Programming. I most recently served as the President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

Currently, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer at Cisco.

Areas of interest include software and systems, static analysis, and reverse engineering.
