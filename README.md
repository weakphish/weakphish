### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John!

I'm a recent graduate of NC State University, where I majored in Political Science with a minor in Computer Programming. I most recently served as the President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

This past Summer (2021), I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton developing router security packages! I learned a lot about networking, C++, and Python.
Coming up in July 2022, I will be joining Cisco full time as a Site Reliability Engineer, which I am _really_ excited about.

Areas of interest include software and systems, static analysis, and reverse engineering.
