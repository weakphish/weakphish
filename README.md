### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jack!

I'm a graduate of NC State University, where I majored in Political Science with a minor in Computer Programming. My senior year (2021-2022), I served as the President of HackPack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

Currently, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer at Cisco in Network Services, as a part of Cisco IT. I joined in July 2022.

Areas of interest include software and systems, static analysis, and programming language design.
